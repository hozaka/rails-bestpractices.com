== Admin Panel Configuration ==

You can configure the admin panel using the initializer the 
generator created. You can find it at +config/initializers/typus.rb+.

=== Admin Title ===

The +admin_title+ is what is shown on the login page and as a header 
of  the admin panel. When the generator is run the application will 
use the folder name of the Rails application.

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.admin_title = "Application Name"
end
----

=== Admin Sub Title ===

The +admin_sub_title+ is shown at the login page and at the admin 
panel footer.

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.admin_sub_title = "Developed by ..."
end
----

=== Authentication ===

There are 3 authentication methods: *none*, *basic*, *advanced*. By 
default the application uses the basic one, which is an http 
authentication. To use the *advanced* method, you'll need to run the 
+typus:migration+ generator as a users table is needed.

----
Typus.config.setup do |config|
  config.authentication = :none|:http_basic|:session
end
----

With the +advanced+ authentication method you'll be able to use the 
role mechanism.

=== Mailer Sender ===

Recover password is disabled by default. To enable it you should 
provide an email address which will be shown as the sender.

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.mailer_sender = "typus@application.com"
end
----

=== Master Role ===

This is the value of the master role of the application. By default we 
use the role admin as the default value.

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.master_role = "admin"
end
----

=== User Class Name ===

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.user_class_name = "TypusUser"
end
----

=== User Fk ===

----
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.user_fk = "typus_user_id"
end
----
