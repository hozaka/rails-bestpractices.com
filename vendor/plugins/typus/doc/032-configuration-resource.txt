== Resource Configuration ==

Sometimes your need to manage some services, view log files or do any 
other task which is not related to a model.

Let's say for example you want to see the +memcached+ status of your 
application and also want to be able to flush all the keys.

First of all we will create a controller:

----
class Admin::MemcachedController < Admin::ResourceController

  def index
    # Here we return the status of the service.
  end

  def flush_all
    # Here we flush all the keys and redirect to the index.
    redirect_to :back, :notice => _("Memcached has been flushed.")
  end

end
----

We will need some views for the new controller. We will create them on 
the application.

----
app/views/admin/memcached/index.html.erb
----

And finally we will add the permissions to +memcached+ as we don't want 
editors to have access to the +flush+ command.

----
# config/typus/application_roles.yml
admin:
  Memcached: index, flush_all

editor:
  Memcached: index
----
