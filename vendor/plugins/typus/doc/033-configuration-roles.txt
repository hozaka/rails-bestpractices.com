== Roles Configuration ==

Typus roles are stored on +yaml+ files. The configuration is really 
easy. On the +config/typus+ folder there are +yaml+ files which end with 
+_roles.yml+. These files is where the setup is done.

You can add as many roles as you want and the access control allow you 
to give access to users from a role to the +CRUD+ methods of a model and 
to custom actions you define per model.

----
admin:
  # Category has access to the default methods.
  Category: create, read, update, delete
  # Posts for example have a custom method called +rebuild+.
  Post: create, read, update, delete, rebuild
  # TypusUser has access to all methods.
  TypusUser: all

editor:
  # An editor will only have access to create and update.
  Category: create, update
  # An editor will only have access to read posts. This means index, 
  # search and show.
  Post: read
----

TIP: Remember you can use the shortcut +all+ to allow user have access 
to all methods.
