=== Does Typus Support Namespaced Models? ===

If you want to be able to use +delayed_job+ you need to add the following 
two lines to your `config/routes.rb` file before +Typus::Routes.draw(map)+.

----
map.connect "admin/delayed/jobs/:action/:id(.:format)", :controller => "admin/delayed/jobs"
----

And then create and configure +config/typus/delayed_job.yml+ and 
+config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml+ as you do with your other models.

File +config/typus/delayed_job.yml+:

----
Delayed::Job:
  fields:
    list: ...
    form: ...
  search: ...
----

File +config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml+:

----
admin:
  Delayed::Job: all
----
