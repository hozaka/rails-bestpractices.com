=== Is it Possible to Use Single Table Inheritance? ===

Single Table Inheritance is **Typus** is relatively simple. For each 
model you have inheriting from a base table you need to have an entry 
in the +application.yml+ file.

Because all models carry the same attributes its possible to create 
an anchored node +(&NAME)+ in the YAML file and then merge that into 
the inheriting nodes with the hash merges +(<<)+ and node reference 
+(*NAME)+, as per the following example:

----
Property: &PROP_BASE
  fields:
    list: address, suburb, ...(chopped)... is_active, visits, is_featured, agency, user
    form: street_number, ...(chopped)... is_under_offer
    show: id, street_number, ...(chopped)... agency, user
    options:
      selectors: property_type, type
  relationships: agency, user
  application: Property Guide

SaleProperty:
  <<: *PROP_BASE

RentalProperty:
  <<: *PROP_BASE

ShareRentalProperty:
  <<: *PROP_BASE

HolidayRentalProperty:
  <<: *PROP_BASE
----

This will setup the parameters which typus will look for when making 
the resources available. In order to make the resources accessible 
you will need to add the following entries into the +application_roles.yml+:

----
admin:
  # Property not listed which means that it isn't shown.
  SaleProperty: all
  RentalProperty: all
  HolidayRentalProperty: all
  ShareRentalProperty: all
----

In addition to this the controller class files also need to be created 
in the +app/controllers/admin+ directory (e.g. +sale_property_controller.rb+, 
which is class +class Admin::SalePropertiesController < Admin::ResourcesController+)

Once this is done, restart your Rails application and visit the admin 
route - the new STI tables should now be available.
