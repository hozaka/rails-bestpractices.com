== User Interface Customization ==

You can customize the admin panel interface overwriting the default 
templates included with the plugin.

=== Views ===

Add your own views to match your application requirements.

----
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/index.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/edit.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/show.html.erb
----

Need a custom view on the Articles listing? Drop the file 
+index.html.erb+ on +app/views/admin/articles+ and the default 
+index.html.erb+ will be replaced for the articles resource.

Want to overwrite the show view for all resources of your application? 
Drop the file +index.html.erb+ on +app/views/admin/resources/+ and the 
default +index.html.erb+ template will be replaced for all resources.

=== Partials ===

You can overwrite partials for all resources or by individual ones:

----
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_index.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_new.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_edit.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_show.html.erb

=== Attribute Templates ===

It is possible to change the presentation for an attribute within the 
form. In the example below the +published_at+ attribute is datetime 
attribute and will use the +_datetime.html.erb+ template located on 
the templates folder +app/views/admin/templates+. The resource and 
the attribute name will be sent as local variables +resource+ and 
+attribute+.

----
# app/views/admin/templates/_datetime.html.erb
<li><label><%= t(attribute.humanize) %></label>
  <%= calendar_date_select :item, attribute %>
</li>
