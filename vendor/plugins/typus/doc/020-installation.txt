== Installation ==

=== Plugin Install ===

To install Typus as a plugin:

----
$ rails plugin install git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git
----

NOTE: To re-install the plugin use the +--force+ option.

=== Gem Install ===

To install **Typus** as a +gem+, edit the application +Gemfile+ and 
add the following line.

----
gem "typus"
----

Install the gem using the bundler:

----
$ bundle install
----

=== Running the Generator ===

Once the plugin or gem is installed you need to run a generator to 
copy **Typus** stylesheets, images and other required files to your 
application.

----
$ rails generate typus
----

By default **Typus** will use an http authentication but if you want 
to use a better authentication system you need to run a second generator.

----
$ rails generate typus:migration
$ rake db:migrate
----

This generator will create a new model, `AdminUser`, in your application, 
some settings which will be stored under `config/typus` folder and will 
also create a migration. You can see some options of this generator running 
the following command.

----
$ rails generate typus:migration -h
----

=== Login into Typus ===

Start the application server, go to http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin and 
follow the instructions.
